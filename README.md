# DaniClicker

**DaniClicker** is a lightweight Blender add-on that lets you spawn any selected object directly into the 3D viewport by simply clicking.  
Left-click to spawn — ESC to exit spawn mode. That’s it. Fast, simple, and interactive.

## Features

- Spawn any selected object with a single click
- Random rotation on X, Y, Z (optional)
- Adjustable scale factor
- Clean and minimal UI in the 3D view sidebar
- ESC to stop spawn mode anytime

## How to Use

1. Install the add-on ZIP via `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`.
2. Go to the 3D Viewport → Sidebar → "DaniClicker" tab.
3. Choose the object to spawn.
4. Set scale and random rotation options.
5. Click “Start Spawn Mode” → Click anywhere in the 3D space to spawn.
6. Press ESC to stop.

## About

This is my **first Blender add-on**, and it’s just the beginning.  
I’m currently working on more tools — much more powerful, creative, and technically advanced.  
If you like this, stay tuned — the next plugins will go way beyond this.
